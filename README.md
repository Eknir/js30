30 Javascript coding challenges (https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/5a62edcda6b56c55273b20ac)

This coding challenge was started after completion of CS50 (https://cs50.harvard.edu/) in order to imporve my javascript fluency.

The code is not written 100% by me. It is more like a coloringbook, where I fill in the missing script/css variables/ html code.
